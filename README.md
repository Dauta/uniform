# uniform 🦄🎩

All-in-one code linter and formatter for TypeScript and JavaScript

## ⚡️ Quickstart

- `npm install @dauta/uniform` or `yarn add @dauta/uniform`
- `npx uniform` or `yarn uniform`

## 🤔 What will this do? 

Installing the package will install eslint and prettier as a dependency of your project, along with several plugins and configuration files. 

Running the `uniform` script, will symlink the predefined configuration files into the root of your project. This will allow your IDE (or whatever extension you're using to run eslint) to read the correct configurations and give realtime feedback on your code. 

## 💻 CLI

To lint your code manually, run `npx uniform lint` or `yarn uniform lint`.

✨ Enjoy!
